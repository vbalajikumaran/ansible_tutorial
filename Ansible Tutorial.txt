1st Tutorial Getting started with Ansible 

The purpose of Ansible is to provision servers. 
Ansible Server will connect to all the server to issue commands for provisioning. 
Ansible is installed on the Ansible server and make connection to the server via SSH and provisioning it. 

2nd Tutorial : Ansible & SSH Overview & Setup

ssh-keygen -t id_ed25519 -C "Ansible key"
cd /home 
cd balaji
cd .ssh file key will exists

ssh-copy-id -i id_ed25519 subha@192.168.1.5

ansible -all -m ping

 
3rd Tutorial : Getting started with Ansible 03 - Setting up the Git Repository

the git hub respository 
Pull down the Respository from git hub respository and make changes and push up the changes to github. 

Create an user name for git hub
Copy the ssh key from ansible system and configure it in github
git clone "github address"  so that file from the github will be moved to the linux system. 
git config --global user.name "vbalajikumaran"
git config --global user.email "vbalajikumaran@yahoo.co.in"
cat ~/.gitconfig

git status
git diff <filename>
git add <filename>
git commit -m "comments"  All uncommited changes. 
git push origin main 


4th Tutorial Running command

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible_key -i inventory -m ping 

Creating config.cfg 
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible_key 

ansible all --list-hosts
ansible -all -m gather_hosts
ansible all -m gather_facts --limit subha@192.168.1.5

5th Tutorial Running elevated commands

sudo-apt update : ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true --become --ask-become-pass

installing vim-nox application : ansible all -m apt -a name=vim-nox --become --ask-become-pass
in client system  run which vim-nox ,apt-search vim-nox

intalling tmux applicaiton :ansible all -m apt -a name=tmux --become --ask-become-pass
in client system  run which tmux  ,apt-search tmux 

in client system we can also see the history of installation 
cd /var/log/apt/history.log

updating all the upgrade in all the server
Server system: ansible all -m apt -a "upgrade=dist" --become --ask-become-pass
client system: sudo apt dist-upgrade -- it should be all application are upgraded


6th Tutorial Working with Playbook
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass remove_apache.yml

7th Tutorial Working with When commands 
Differentiate playbook by hosts in terms of which distribution is running. (Ubuntu , Debian or Red hat)
cat /etc/os-release   -- To check the server details
When command usage 
•	when ansible_distribution == "Debian"
•	when ansible_distribution in ["Debian","Ubuntu"]
•	when ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_distribution_version = "8.2"
ansible all -m gather_facts --limit subha@192.168.1.5
Centos http server will not run automatically following steps need to do 
•	systemctl status httpd
•	sudo systemctl start httpd
•	sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp  output will be --success
•	run the ipaddress on the browser

9: Targetting specific Hosts
